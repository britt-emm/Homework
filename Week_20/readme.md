# What is cat_count.py
cat_count.py is a program that takes in a text file cats_txt.txt and returns a list of tuples containing the words and punctuation from the file and the number of times each word/punctuation mark occurs in the text, in the order from most frequent to least frequent.

It also returns a list of tuples that returns the words and punctuation in the text minus a set of words that are least likely to provide useful information about the text. 

## How to run the "cat_count.py" program

1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to the folder containing the "cat_count.py" file, in this case you may do that by typing cd Documents/CoderGirl_Data_Science/Homework/Week_20/

4. This will run the code.

### This is a useful exercise as part of NLP because it can give you an idea of what the text might be about if you don't know that yet.
