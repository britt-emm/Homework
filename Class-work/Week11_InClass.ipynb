    "Why is this called \"exponential\"? (Try writing out what the first few terms work out to be)\n",
    "It is incrementing in very small sections\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if you make the \"factor\" in the code much smaller? Try .01, .001. It becomes much smoother and shifted when it's smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you expect this to be faster or slower than implementing a rolling average? This is much slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try running the two methods - you can even use the time module to measure performance.  Which method is faster? Rolling is faster.\n",
    "I used the time.perf_counter and caclulating the exponential smoothing returned:\n",
    "Ran exponential in 13.5195 seconds\n",
    "Calculating the rolling mean returned: Ran rolling in 0.0062 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "In applications where you want to smooth data as it arrives in real time, it's very common to use exponential smoothing instead of a rolling average - why do you think this might be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling you really want all of the data points whereas exponential you can run it as the point come in. For rolling you need to wait until you have all of the data points for that increment."
